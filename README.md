# reinforcementLearning
This python project is one of my first Reinforcement Learning projects in which an agent (color red) can find the destination (color purple). 
The code runs 200 episodes and the number at the bottom of the screen is the number of the episode that is currently being displayed.(not all are displayed)
The second tab that pops after the first one is closed is the last episode to demonstrate the last state of the reinforcement learning agent.
After the destination is reached there is a heatmap and a learning graph available.
